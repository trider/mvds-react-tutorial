# ReactJS for Angular Developers a Practical Guide: Overview and Motivation

This article is an introduction to an ongoing series where I look at ReactJS through the eyes of a seasoned Angular Developer. While I have some previous experience with React, it now seems like it was lifetimes ago. Recently, I decided to reacquaint myself with React, after relearning everything from scratch, using what I had learned in the process to build a sample task management app. The result was react-task-manger that went from a basic single page displaying a single table to a more complex and sophisticated application.

After achieving my initial goals, I felt sufficiently competent in React to move on to other things. When I next revisited the project, I had a general idea of what everything did but understanding what I had created required more effort than I expected. To avoid repeating the same mistake, I decided to create a practical guide to learning React based on the code I had written. I took the project and broke it down into five smaller mini-projects. Each mini-project would illustrate specific React features with each new project building on the knowledge acquired in the previous step.

As a long-time Angular developer in the process of learning React, I had to reexamine some of my assumptions regarding Frontend development. In some ways, the process is similar to learning a dialect of your mother tongue in that itâ€™s both similar and very different from the language you are familiar with. Another striking difference is that Angular gives you nearly everything you need and has very clear ideas of how you should do it, while React gives you the basics and some recommendations, how you go is up to you. As a result, I thought it would be interesting to include my observations and experience as an Angular developer exploring the world of React.
With that out of the way, get ready for the first article in this series that will explore Routing and Navigation.
