# Rapid React Tutorial

Back in 2017, I was a humble hybrid mobile developer. I thought I had found a niche in building cross-platform mobile apps with Ionic, PhoneGap, and Angular 1x. Then, I got a job doing the same thing with the new-fangled ReactNative. At the time, I was barely aware of ReactJS, let alone its close sibling.

Fast forward to today, and React is everywhere. As a long-time Angular 2x dev, I love the platform, but React is eating Angular's lunch in terms of popularity. I have come to the realization that if you want to make it in the world of web development, either as a Frontend or Fullstack developer, you really need to know React.

That is why I'm launching my latest tutorial, Rapid React. In this series, I aim to get you up and running, building your own React-based web apps as rapidly as possible. Furthermore, unlike my previous Node Express tutorials, this series will also have a much faster publishing cadence. More news as it happens.
